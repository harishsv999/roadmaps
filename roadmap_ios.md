#### **12. Testing and Debugging**
Writing tests and debugging for high-quality apps.

- **Topics:**
  - Unit testing with XCTest
  - UI testing
  - Debugging with breakpoints
  - Profiling with Instruments
- **Task:** Write unit and UI tests for an existing app and analyze memory usage using Instruments.
